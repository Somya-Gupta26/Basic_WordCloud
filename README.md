# Basic_WordCloud
This is a WordCloud that I created using Python visualization libraries.

Word Cloud is a visual representation of text data which is often used to depict keyword metadata on websites, or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color.
